For each of the 13 reasons why architecture is important articulated in this chapter, take the contrarian position: Propose a set of circumstances under which architecture is not necessary to achieve the result indicated.

 5. Prioritize the list of 13 reasons in this chapter according to some criteria that are meaningful to you. Justify your answer. Or, if you could choose only two or three of the reasons to promote the use of architecture in a project, which would you choose and why?
