### Chapter Review Questions
1. What is system engineering?
	System engineering is a process that covers the entire life cycle of the system; defining phases and activities from the initial concept to system retirement. This process highlights the importance of understanding and meeting the customer's business needs.
	Furthermore, system engineering uses a top-down divide-and-conquer approach, breaking the system into subsystems and components to enable separate development. This method enables teams to handle large, complex systems effectively.
	Lastly, system engineering is considered an interdisciplinary because different teams work together to carry out development activities. This ensures all aspects of the system are addressed effectively.
2. Why do we need system engineering?
	We need system engineering to deal with the challenges of the interdisciplinary effort from the hardware, software and human resources development. For example, how do we identify and formulate system requirements for such systems? How do we design and construct such systems? And how do we manage the development activities? How do we measure the performance, reliability, safety, and other factors of such systems? How do we assess the impact of the system to the society and environment?
3. Why is system engineering considered an interdisciplinary approach?
	System engineering is considered an interdisciplinary approach because there are members from different fields that work together to carry out the system development activities.
4. What are the phases and activities of the system engineering approaches described in this chapter?

5. What are the purposes of hardware development, software development, and human resource development, and why are they performed separately?

6. How does the system engineering process tackle the system development challenges?
	Install the system into the target environment and test system by users.
7. What is the relationship between system engineering and software engineering?
	The software engineering team applies software engineering processes and methodologies to develop the software subsystem. The software engineering team also performs quality assurance and management activities. The software engineering team maintains close contact, exchange progress status and collaborate with each other to solve interdisciplinary design and implementation problems.
8. What factors should the system engineering team consider during system design?
	
9. What are the applicable strategies for decomposing a system or subsystem during system design?
	* Decompose the system according to system functions
	* Decompose the system according to disciplines
	* Decompose the system according to existing architecture
	* Decompose the system according to the functional units of the organization
	* Decompose the system according to models of the application
10. ==What is system modeling **DON'T KNOW**==
11. What is a requirement-subsystem traceability matrix?
	The allocation of the system requirements to the subsystems is visualized in a traceability matrix as shown in Figure 3.4. The rows show the requirements while the columns show the subsystems. The entries indicate the allocation of the requirements to the subsystems. For a real-world project, the traceability matrix is large because it involves hundreds of requirements and many subsystems. Therefore, Figure 3.4 is only an illustration.

12. What are the potential challenges of system integration and testing?
	* Incompatibility between different systems.
	* Scope and schedule
	* Errors and defects
	* Documentation and traceability
