### Review Questions
1. What is a software process, and what are the process models presented?
	A software process is a series of phases of activities performed to construct a software system. Each phase produces some artifacts which are the input to other phases. Each phase has a set of entrance criteria and a set of exit criteria.
2. What are the strengths and weaknesses of the waterfall process?
	**Advantages:** Straight sequence of phases of the waterfall process greatly simplifies project planning, project scheduling, and project status tracking. The straight sequence of functional activities allows function-oriented project organization. The phased approach is appropriate for some large, complex, long-lasting, embedded systems.
	**Disadvantages:** The one strict sequence of phases and related milestones makes it difficult to respond to requirements change. The long development duration is unacceptable because the requirements were identified long ago and business needs have changed dramatically. Users cannot experiment with the system to provide feedback until it's released. Customers cannot reap the benefits of the new system during the long development period. Customers have to accept the risk of low return on investment if the project is cancelled
3. What is a software development methodology? What are the differences between a process and a methodology?
	A software development methodology defines the steps or how to carry out the activities of a software process. A software process specifies the input and output of each phase, but it does not dictate the representations of the input and output

4. ==What are agile processes and agile methods? What are the life-cycle activities of the agile methods presented? **NOT TOO SURE**==
5. What are the properties of tame problems and wicked problems, respectively?

6. ==Why is software development in general a wicked problem? **NOT TOO SURE**==
7. How do agile processes tackle software development as a wicked problem?
	Agile processes emphasize teamwork, joint application development with the users, design for change, and rapid development and frequent delivery of small increments in short iterations. Agile development is guided by agile values, principles and best practices.
8. ==Will agile development replace the conventional approaches such as the waterfall process? **NOT TOO SURE**==

### Exercises
1. What are the similarities and differences between the conventional waterfall model and the Unified Process model? Identify and explain three advantages and three disadvantages of each of these two models.
	The waterfall model and the Unified Process (UP) model are similar in the sense that they are process models, they define phases, the activities and products of each of the phases. The waterfall process is a sequential process although backtracking is possible. The UP, on the other hand, is an iterative, incremental process. Waterfall process advantages are: (1) it facilitates project management, scheduling and status tracking, (2) its can be used for function-oriented team organzation, and (3) it is more appropriate for some types of software project. Its disadvantages are: (1) it is difficult to respond to requirements change, (2) the long development duration is unacceptable, and (3) users cannot experiment with the system until late in the development life cycle. UP advantages are: (1) its iterative process can better accommodate requirements change because changes can be made to remaining iterations, (2) it is use-case driven, allowing the development team to focus on customer value — that is, development and deployment of high-priority use cases as early as possible, (3) it is incremental, this reduces the risk of requirements misconception. It disadvantages are: (1) an iterative process is more difficult to manage and schedule, (2) the early versions of the UP emphasize too much on documentation and much of it is not used, (3) the UP is a process, not a methodology, therefore, it is useful only for experienced software developers.
2. Write an essay about how a good process and a good methodology help tackling the project and product challenges. Limit the length of the essay to five pages, or according to the instructions of the instructor..
	There could be many different answers to this exercise. It is difficult to come up with a standard solution and use it to grade the submissions. However, the answer should show how a good process and methodology address each of the challenges. Figure 2.1 of this manual highlights the main points and provides pointers to related chapters. Grading of this exercise could be done by reading the solutions submitted by the students, according to the writing, the grader classifies the solutions into 3-5 categories such as very good, good, fair, below, and poor. Each of the categories is then reviewed and a score is assigned to each of the solution.
4. Write an essay that discusses the following two issues: (1) The pros and cons of plan driven development and agile development processes, respectively. (2) Whether and why agile development will, or will not, replace plan-driven approaches.
	The solution to (1) is similar to the solution about the differences between the waterfall and UP process models. The answer to (2) can be “yes” or “no,” and the answer is not that important. The importance is the understanding of the differences between the two approaches, and the student’s reasoning to justify the conclusion. This exercise should be graded using the method described in the solution for Exercise 2.
5. Write a short article that answers the following questions: (1) What are the similarities and differences between the spiral process, the Unified Process, and an agile process. (2) What are the pros and cons of each of these processes. (3) Which types of projects should apply which of these processes?
	The similarities are that they are iterative processes, and meant to be an improvement over the existing processes. However, the iterations in the spiral process is situation dependent — that is, what to perform next depends on the outcome of the current iteration. Moreover, risk management is a unique feature of the spiral process. Unlike the spiral process, the UP repeats the same four phases in each iteration. It does not require the spiral process like decision making. It also does not indicate risk management. Agile processes are different from the spiral and UP in the agile manifesto, agile practices and values, and agile principles. In addition, agile development tend to adopt short iterations and frequent delivery of small increments. There are other differences but a solution should focus on these. Among the three choices, projects that are research-oriented or exploratory may use the spiral process. Projects that require adequate documentation should use the UP. Projects that need to respond quickly to changing business environments, and hence software requirements, should use an agile process. There are subtle differences between “research-oriented” and “changing requirements.” Both need to tackle changing requirements. Research-oriented requirements need to be discovered with research tasks and experiments, which require considerable time and effort, and the costs are high.
6. Explain in an essay why the waterfall process is a process for solving tame problems.
	The waterfall process requires that the requirements of the system must be identified, clearly and completely defined before the design and implementation of the system. This is at least true in theory, although many real-world projects do not happen like this. The first two properties of wicked problems are: (1) a wicked problem does not have a definite formulation, and (2) the specification of the problem and the solution cannot be separated. Clearly, the waterfall process cannot solve wicked problems because the problem-solving process does not address these two wicked-problem properties. A student’s solution may address other properties as well. (See also solution to Exercise 7, especially Figure 2.2 of this manual. From the discussion and the Figure 2.2, one may infer more on the inadequacy of waterfall in solving software development as a wicked problem.)
7. Explain in an essay how agile development tackles application software development as a wicked problem.
	Software development as a wicked problem implies that the requirements for a software system cannot be completely and definitely formulated, and the specification and the solution cannot be separated — the specification is the solution, and vice versa. Agile development recognizes these and advocates responding to requirements change. The 20/80 rule indicates that it is good enough to identify 80% of the requirements that are of high customer value. In additiion, it advocates capturing requirements at a high level, lightweight, and visual. That is, low-level requirements are to be captured during the implementation phase. This is because the specification and the solution cannot be separated. Agile development also emphasizes on user involvement because the “correctness” of a software system cannot be determined objectively and scientifically. Figure 2.2 of this manual shows how agile manifesto and principles solve wicked problems.
