What is software architecture?
* A non-operational software that determines the system qualities
	* It shows the effectiveness of the desing in meetings its stated requirements
	* Considers architectural alernatives at a stage when making desing changes is still relatively easy
	* Reduces the risks associated with the construction of the software
* Building the system's architectural design structure?
	* What are the 3 requirements
		* Functional
		* Non-functional
			* Quality requirements/attributes quantification
			* Architectural patterns (Arch styles)
			* Architectural strategies (Arch Tactics)
			* Architectural constraints
		* Technology
			* Used to design the deployment model of the system
* Non Functional Requirements Extraction
	* What are the needs for the software system's structure (i.e, an architectural diagram of the system)?
	* Four or more quality requirements addresses one of more functional requirements
	* Quality requirements must be quantifiable
		* Usability
		* Availability
		* Performance
		* Scalability
		* Security
	* Architectural Patterns
	* Architectural Strategies
* Quality requirements (quality attributes)
	* Specify criteria that define how well a sof
